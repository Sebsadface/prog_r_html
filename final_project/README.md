 In this final project we will answer some of the major questions that we are interested in by _finding and analyzing data sets_ that we find available online.

### Domain of interest
- The domain of our choice is **climate change**. Climate change is something important to address and understand, so we want to do some data analysis to determine the effect it already has on different parts of the world and whether it has already begun to impact people's lives.

- There are a lot of **data driven projects** related to climate change. Here are three of them:

  1. [_Understanding Climate Change: A Data Driven Approach_](http://climatechange.cs.umn.edu) is done by a project team led by the University of Minnesota. This project addresses key challenges in the science of climate change to help understanding climate change.

  2. NOAA's [_CM2 Global Coupled Climate Models (CM2.X)_](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/model-data/model-datasets/cm2-global-coupled-climate-models-cm2x) consists of two climate models, which were designed to model the changes in climate over the past century and into the 21st century.

  3. Google's [_Environmental Insights Explorer (EIE)_](https://insights.sustainability.google) is a free online tool that makes it easier for cities to measure, plan and reduce overall carbon emissions and pollution across their cities. It enables them to take actions on climate change.

- Here are **three questions** that we hope to answer in this project:

    1. _How have the number of days of extreme weather changed over the past 50 or more years, particularly in the United States?_ This can be answered by comparing the number of days of each year that had extreme weather.

    2. _How do the average temperatures of each state in the United States today compare to the mean temperatures of past 50 years or more?_ This can be answered by comparing the average temperature of this year with the mean temperature of the past years.

    3. _What is the trend of average precipitation and snowfall of each state in the United States over the last 50 years or more?_ This can be answered by calculating the average amount of precipitation of each year and comparing them with each other.

### Finding Data
- [U.S. Climate Extremes Index (CEI)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremes/cei/graph) is based on an aggregate set of conventional climate extreme indicators which include the following types of data collected by **NOAA**: monthly maximum and minimum temperature,  daily precipitation, monthly Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), landfalling tropical storm and hurricane wind velocity. There are **109 observations** and **3 features** in this data. It can answer **the first question** above.

- [Monthly Climate Conditions](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/divisional/mapping) is come from weather stations in **the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily (GHCN-D)**. There are **4810 observations** and **6 features** in this data. It can answer **the second question** above.

- [Temperature and Precipitation Trends](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/national/time-series)are recorded at regular intervals at **weather and climate stations across the country**, both through manual observation and automated instruments. There are **125 observations** and **3 features** in this data. It can answer **the third question** above.
